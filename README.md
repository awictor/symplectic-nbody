# symplectic-nbody

A dependency-free (pure-Python stdlib) N-body gravitational simulator built to
make one deep fact of numerical physics *observable and testable*:

> **Symplectic integrators conserve energy over exponentially long times.
> Higher local accuracy (RK4) does not save you — its energy drifts secularly.**

This is why real celestial-mechanics codes integrate the solar system for
billions of years with a humble 2nd-order leapfrog instead of a fancy
adaptive Runge-Kutta.

## Quick look

```

Look at the `net dE/E` column and the drift shape. The symplectic methods'
energy **oscillates around zero and returns**. RK4's energy **walks off in one
direction** — a monotone ramp. That ramp is the secular drift that eventually
ruins a long non-symplectic integration.

## Barnes-Hut: scaling to many bodies

Direct summation is O(N^2). For a star cluster of thousands of bodies that is
hopeless. `barnes_hut.py` builds an octree, collapses distant groups of bodies
to their centre of mass, and uses them wholesale when the opening angle
`theta = cell_width / distance` is small enough. Same acceleration interface, so
it drops straight into the same symplectic integrators.

```
$ python examples/scaling_benchmark.py

     N    direct (ms)     bh (ms)   speedup
---------------------------------------------
   200           9.15       12.19      0.8x
  3200        2680.78     1126.60      2.4x

empirical scaling exponent  direct ~ N^2.04   barnes-hut ~ N^1.64
```

`theta=0` reproduces direct summation to machine precision; `theta=0.5` is the
classic accuracy/speed sweet spot (matches exact forces to a few percent).
Tightening `theta` provably reduces the error — all checked in the tests. The
`plummer_sphere(n=...)` generator builds an equilibrium cluster (positions from
the Plummer inverse-CDF, velocities by rejection sampling the exact distribution
function) using a tiny built-in LCG, so it's deterministic and dependency-free.

## Ground truth: convergence against the exact Kepler orbit

The two-body problem has a closed-form solution (solve Kepler's equation
`M = E - e sin E` for the eccentric anomaly). `kepler.py` gives the *exact*
position at any time, so we can measure an integrator's true error -- and read
its convergence order straight off the data by halving the step:

```
$ python examples/convergence_demo.py

verlet:                      forest_ruth:                 rk4:
   steps     error  order       steps     error  order      steps     error  order
    1000  1.13e-04   2.00        1000  5.07e-08   4.00       1000  5.80e-09   4.10
    2000  2.81e-05   2.00        2000  3.17e-09   4.00       2000  3.50e-10   4.05
    4000  7.03e-06   2.00        4000  1.98e-10   4.00       4000  2.15e-11   4.03
```

Halving the step cuts verlet's error 4x (order 2) and forest_ruth/rk4's error
16x (order 4) -- exactly as theory predicts, confirmed empirically. forest_ruth
and rk4 share an order, but only forest_ruth is symplectic, so only it also keeps
energy bounded forever. Order buys short-term accuracy; symplecticity buys
long-term stability. This repo measures both.

## Adaptive stepping: same accuracy, far less work

Symplectic methods win the *long-term energy* game. But when you just need a
high-accuracy trajectory over a bounded time, an error-controlled adaptive step
wins the *efficiency* game -- it spends tiny steps at pericenter (where the orbit
moves fast) and long steps at apocenter (where nothing happens).

```
$ python examples/adaptive_demo.py

adaptive step size over the orbit (small=pericenter, large=apocenter):
  .=+**###@##*+==---::..::::.......  ..........::::::--===++*#######*-
  steps accepted=109 rejected=13  h_min=1.00e-03 h_max=1.17e-01 ratio=117x

method                     force evals     end error
----------------------------------------------------
adaptive DP45                      854      3.95e-08
fixed RK4 (2000 steps)            8000      8.02e-09

adaptive reaches the same accuracy with 9.4x fewer force evaluations.
```

`adaptive.DormandPrince` is the Dormand-Prince 5(4) embedded pair (the method
behind MATLAB's `ode45` / SciPy's `RK45`): two solutions of different order share
the same stages, their difference estimates the local error, and the step grows
or shrinks to hold that error near tolerance. It is **not** symplectic, so it's
the right tool for bounded high-accuracy runs, not billion-year integrations --
the complement to the leapfrog family, and the contrast makes the tradeoff clear.

## Plotting orbits (no dependencies)

```
python examples/plot_orbits.py examples/output
```

Writes standalone SVGs you can open in any browser -- see `examples/output/`.
`render_svg.py` projects the 3D trajectory onto a chosen plane, draws each body's
path as a polyline (hollow marker = start, filled = end), and stamps the net
energy drift. The figure-eight closes on itself to 1 part in 1e13; the softened
pythagorean 3-body stays energy-stable (drift ~1e-9) through its close encounters.

It also writes an `*_animated.svg` for each system: the bodies actually **orbit**
along their computed paths using SMIL `<animateMotion>` -- pure declarative SVG
animation, no JavaScript, no dependencies. Open `figure_eight_animated.svg` in a
browser and watch three masses chase each other around the shared figure-eight.

## The claims, checked automatically

Run:

```
python tests/test_conservation.py
```

1. **Verlet keeps energy bounded** — relative drift stays below 1e-3 over 20k steps.
2. **Forest-Ruth beats Verlet** — 4th order has smaller max energy error than 2nd.
3. **RK4 drifts secularly** — on an eccentric orbit, the least-squares *slope* of
   RK4's energy error exceeds Verlet's by >3x (Verlet only oscillates; RK4 ramps).
4. **Momentum conserved** — linear & angular momentum held to ~1e-9.

## The math, briefly

A symplectic integrator exactly conserves a *shadow Hamiltonian* H̃ = H + O(dt^p)
that stays close to the true H. Because H̃ is conserved exactly, the true energy H
can only oscillate within O(dt^p) of its start — it can never drift away. RK4
conserves no nearby Hamiltonian, so nothing pins its energy, and truncation error
accumulates into a one-way walk.

`velocity_verlet` uses the kick-drift-kick (leapfrog) form; `forest_ruth` uses the
Forest & Ruth (1990) triple-jump coefficients w1 = 1/(2 - 2^(1/3)).

## Design notes

- **Zero dependencies.** Pure stdlib `math`. Runs on any Python 3.
- **G = 1 units**, the convention for celestial-mechanics test problems.
- **Softening** parameter tames the r -> 0 singularity for chaotic close encounters.
- O(N^2) direct summation — clear over clever. A Barnes-Hut tree is the natural
  next step for large N.
