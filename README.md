# symplectic-nbody

A dependency-free (pure-Python stdlib) N-body gravitational simulator built to
make one deep fact of numerical physics *observable and testable*:

> **Symplectic integrators conserve energy over exponentially long times.
> Higher local accuracy (RK4) does not save you — its energy drifts secularly.**

This is why real celestial-mechanics codes integrate the solar system for
billions of years with a humble 2nd-order leapfrog instead of a fancy
adaptive Runge-Kutta.

Look at the `net dE/E` column and the drift shape. The symplectic methods'
energy **oscillates around zero and returns**. RK4's energy **walks off in one
direction** — a monotone ramp. That ramp is the secular drift that eventually
ruins a long non-symplectic integration.

## What's inside

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `src/integrators.py` | `velocity_verlet` (2nd-order symplectic), `forest_ruth` (4th-order symplectic), `rk4` (non-symplectic foil) |
| `src/nbody.py` | Newtonian forces, kinetic/potential energy, linear & angular momentum, softening |
| `src/systems.py` | Test systems: circular & eccentric two-body, the figure-eight choreography, Burrau's pythagorean 3-body |

## The claims, checked automatically

Run:

```
python tests/test_conservation.py
```

1. **Verlet keeps energy bounded** — relative drift stays below 1e-3 over 20k steps.
2. **Forest-Ruth beats Verlet** — 4th order has smaller max energy error than 2nd.
3. **RK4 drifts secularly** — on an eccentric orbit, the least-squares *slope* of
   RK4's energy error exceeds Verlet's by >3x (Verlet only oscillates; RK4 ramps).
4. **Momentum conserved** — linear & angular momentum held to ~1e-9.

## The math, briefly

A symplectic integrator exactly conserves a *shadow Hamiltonian* H̃ = H + O(dt^p)
that stays close to the true H. Because H̃ is conserved exactly, the true energy H
can only oscillate within O(dt^p) of its start — it can never drift away. RK4
conserves no nearby Hamiltonian, so nothing pins its energy, and truncation error
accumulates into a one-way walk.

`velocity_verlet` uses the kick-drift-kick (leapfrog) form; `forest_ruth` uses the
Forest & Ruth (1990) triple-jump coefficients w1 = 1/(2 - 2^(1/3)).

## Design notes

- **Zero dependencies.** Pure stdlib `math`. Runs on any Python 3.
- **G = 1 units**, the convention for celestial-mechanics test problems.
- **Softening** parameter tames the r -> 0 singularity for chaotic close encounters.
- O(N^2) direct summation — clear over clever. A Barnes-Hut tree is the natural
  next step for large N.
